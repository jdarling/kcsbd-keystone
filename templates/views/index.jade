		p Known as the greatest amateur racing event, Soap Box Derby is a youth racing program that began in 1934 and has been an organized sport in Kansas City since 1947. Girls and boys ages 7-20 build their gravity powered racers with the help of a parent or another adult and compete against other racers reaching speeds up to 30 miles an hour on the dedicated track at 4600 Eastern Avenue in Kansas City Missouri. Racers learn the skill of quality workmanship, the thrill of competition, the importance of sportsmanship and the fulfillment of perseverance. Soap Box Derby builds close parent/child relationships and creates memories that will last a lifetime.
		p Rallies are sanctioned by either the All-American Soap Box Derby (AA) or National Derby Rallies, Inc. (NDR). AA competitors may be 8 years through 17 years old, and NDR participants may be 7 years to 21 years old.
